## 1. Overview

This document details the implementation of the `App.js` component, which serves as the main application entry point.  The component manages authentication and conditionally renders different views based on user roles (administrator or therapist).

## 2. Function: App()

The `App()` function is the core of the application. It utilizes React's `useContext` hook to access authentication tokens from `AdminContext` and `TherapistContext`. Based on the presence of these tokens, it renders either the main application interface or the login screen.

### 2.1 Authentication and Routing Logic

The core logic within `App()` involves conditional rendering based on authentication status:

| Condition                     | Rendered Component(s)                                 | Description                                                                       |
|------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `therapistToken || aToken` | Main application interface (NavBar, SideBar, Routes) | Renders the application's main layout including navigation and route components. |
| `!(therapistToken || aToken)` | Login component                                      | Displays the login screen if no authentication token is present.                   |


The authentication check (`therapistToken || aToken`) uses a short-circuiting OR operator.  If either `therapistToken` or `aToken` is truthy (meaning the user is logged in as either a therapist or administrator), the main application UI is rendered. Otherwise, the login screen is shown.

The main application UI leverages React Router's `Routes` component to define different routes for administrators and therapists:


**Admin Routes:**

* `/`: Empty route (likely a redirect to `/admin-dashboard`)
* `/admin-dashboard`: `Dashboard` component
* `/all-appointments`: `AllAppointments` component
* `/add-therapist`: `AddTherapist` component
* `/therapist-list`: `TherapistList` component
* `/feedback`: `Feedback` component


**Therapist Routes:**

* `/therapist-dashboard`: `TherapistDashboard` component
* `/therapist-appointments`: `TherapistAppointments` component
* `/therapist-profile`: `TherapistProfile` component


The `ToastContainer` component from `react-toastify` is included to display notifications throughout the application (included in both the logged-in and logged-out views).


## 3. Component Structure

The application's UI is structured as follows:

* **Top Level:** `App` component manages authentication and routing.
* **Authentication:**  `AdminContext` and `TherapistContext` provide authentication status.
* **Layout:**
    * `NavBar`:  Top navigation bar.
    * `SideBar`:  Sidebar for navigation within the application.
* **Content:**  The main application content is determined by the route, and is rendered conditionally based on the user's authentication status.

The conditional rendering based on authentication ensures that only authorized users can access specific sections of the application, enhancing security.  The use of React Router simplifies navigation and management of different application views.
